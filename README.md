# Advent of Code 2022

This year I'm once again planning to _~~over engineer~~ have better infrastructure for my code (and also actually finish it, or at least get past day 8...)_

Less so that the largely banal, weirdly trivial, and thoroughly arbitrary aspirations of last year, from whence that be quoted. Simple, straightforward CI/CD, testing, and build automation are the goals that exist other than completion. 

Let's see how this year goes. 


#### Stretch goals:
- Unnecessary decorators
- Unnecessary factory pattern implementations
- Entirely unnecessary containerisation
- Thoroughly unnecessary usage of dynamic registries
- The usual attempt to write perl one-liners in python
- Some absurdly pointless inheritance
